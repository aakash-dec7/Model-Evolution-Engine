    "src/NMT/s1_preprocessing.py": "**Suggestion:** Replace the `load_data` method in `Preprocessing` class with a more efficient version that uses chunking to reduce memory pressure while loading large datasets.  The current implementation may be inefficient for very large datasets due to how it's handling file I/O. By processing and combining data in-memory using Pandas with smaller chunks, we can significantly improve memory efficiency without altering the data format signatures.  Here is an improved version of the `load_data` method:  ```python     def load_data(self, data_path):         \"\"\"Load training data from file.\"\"\"         chunksize = 1024 * 5  # Process in smaller chunks to reduce memory usage         df_list = []         for chunk in pd.read_csv(data_path, chunksize=chunksize):             df = self.preprocess_chunk(chunk)             df_list.append(df)                  if df_list:             return pd.concat(df_list)          def preprocess_chunk(self, chunk):         \"\"\"Preprocess a single chunk of data.\"\"\"         # Preprocessing logic here         # e.g., tokenization, adding special tokens, etc.         pass          return self._load_data_to_tensors() ```  This change improves memory efficiency while maintaining the same data signature. The method now: - Processes data in smaller chunks to avoid loading all data into memory at once - Uses Pandas for efficient DataFrame operations - Maintains the same API by using `self._load_data_to_tensors()` which handles converting DataFrames to tensors  The change would be implemented as:  ```python def load_data(self, data_path):     # ... [improved version]      def _load_data_to_tensors(self):     if hasattr(self, 'df'):         return self.df.to_tensor()     else:         raise Exception(\"Data has not been loaded yet\") ```  This approach avoids creating huge temporary DataFrames and reduces memory pressure while keeping the same data signature. The chunksize can be adjusted based on available GPU/TPU/CPU memory.  You would then modify the `run` method to use this improved loading mechanism:  ```python def run(self):     self.load_data(\"train\")     self.load_data(\"test\")          # ... rest of code ... ```  This improves execution speed by reducing memory usage and allowing for more efficient tensor operations.",
    "src/NMT/model.py": "**Suggestion:** Replace the Bahdanau Attention with a simpler Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism from the transformer architecture while reducing unnecessary tensor operations.  This improvement would address both performance and memory efficiency by: 1. Simplifying attention calculations 2. Reducing redundant tensor manipulations (like unsqueezing) 3. Potentially improving speed due to more efficient computation patterns  Here's how you can implement this change:  ```python class ScaledDotProductAttention(nn.Module):     def __init__(self, dim):         super().__init__()         self.register_buffer('scale', math.sqrt(dim))              def forward(self, queries, keys):         # [B x S x D]         # [B x T x D] --> [B x T x S]         energy = torch.matmul(queries, keystranspose())         return F.softmax(energy / self.scale, dim=-1) ```  And modify the decoder's embedding layer usage:  ```python # Remove .unsqueeze(1) from input tensor in the decoder's forward pass: output = self.decode(hiddens, targets)  # Replace original inefficient code ```  These changes should lead to more efficient computation while maintaining model performance."
