            Analyze the given code and provide exactly **one** high-impact improvement suggestion.  

            **Guidelines:**  
            - Focus on **Model performance, memory efficiency, and execution speed**.  
            - **Do NOT modify data formats** (e.g., CSV, JSON, or NPZ) to ensure pipeline compatibility.  
            - Ensure suggestions **preserve existing data structures and I/O formats**.  
            - Be specificâ€”mention exact **functions, libraries, or techniques**.  
            - Use metadata to ensure project consistency.  
            - Respond **only** with the suggestion in **text markdown** format (no explanations).  

            **Code:**  
            ```python
